# README.md - ggplot2_examples

This repository contains [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/) code for replicating examples from Hadley Wickham's book [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org/book/), which can be purchased at many bookstores, both brick and online.

The book's website has a link to all the code used to generate example figures. This directory differs from that, in that I was taking notes as I went along, and was also using the exercise to practise `knitr` - so you get `knitr` code, too. 

I might continue to keep up this repository with further examples as I go along, or extend/modify it to be some kind of teaching resource - but I wouldn't hold my breath, if I were youâ€¦
